# Neighborhood Map Project

### Requirements

You will require an internet connection to run this application locally because it uses a `fetch` request to get data asynchronously from the Foursquare API.

### Opening the Application

The file to start the application is `index.html`. Open this file to launch the application.

## Using the Application

Once the application is loaded, you are able to see all the initial locations.

Clicking on a location on the `map` will display the location's name and the corresponding Foursquare rating.

Click on the hamburger menu icon located in the top left of the title bar on the page to open up the options menu which will enable you to filter the locations by name and type. To close this menu click on the red `X` icon located in the top right corner of the options menu.
